/**
 * Patterns Module
 *
 * Pattern components implement complex UI patterns that combine multiple
 * composites and primitives to solve specific user experience problems.
 *
 * These are opinionated implementations of common patterns such as:
 * - Data tables with sorting/filtering
 * - Form layouts
 * - Navigation patterns
 * - Search interfaces
 *
 * @module presentation/patterns
 */

// Pattern components will be added here
// Example exports (to be implemented):
// export { DataTable } from "./data-table";
// export { SearchCombobox } from "./search-combobox";

export {};
